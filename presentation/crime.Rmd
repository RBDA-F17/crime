### Analytics Project

`r params$set_title`

### Team
<!-- incremental bulletes with >- -->
-  Carlos Petricioli (cpa253)

-  Varsha Muralidharan  (vm1370)

-  Valerie Angulo (vaa238)

### Abstract

- We study crime rates and its relationship on how people use of taxis in New York City. 
- Our hypothesis is that people are less likely to walk in areas subjectively deemed more dangerous and will instead opt to use more reliable and immediate transportation such as designated taxis. 
- WE FOUND THAT ____. 




# `r params$set_title`

## Motivation

### Typical user of this application
The scientific community, the citizens and demographics themselves.

### Insight that we'll get

The objective is to get a better sense of the way that crime relates to the use of taxis in NYC.

## Goodness

## Data Sources


### Taxi rides data form TLC [(*Link*)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml)

- It covers years from 2009 to June 2017.

- The yellow taxi trip records include:

  + pick-up and drop-off dates/times, 
  + pick-up and drop-off locations, 
  + trip distance,
  + itemized fares, 
  + rate types, 
  + payment type, 
  + passenger counts.

### NYPD Complaint Data  [(*Link 1,*](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i) [*Link 2)*](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-YTD/5uac-w243)

- This dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to year to date data.


### NOAA Weather stations data [*(Link)*](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd)

The *Integrated Surface Database (ISD)* consists of global hourly ansynoptic observations compiled from numerous sources into a single common ASCII format and common data model.

- ISD's complete history of hour-by-hour readings for one user-specified weather stations

- We selected:
  + Central Park
  + JFK 
  + Laguardia
